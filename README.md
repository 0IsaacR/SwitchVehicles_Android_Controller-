The goal of this project is to design supplemental device that would make a vehicle "smart". We have utilized affordable hardware components to produce an affordable smart vehicle system compared to those already available in the market. Since cell phones are a major part of millennial students’ culture, we came up with the idea of controlling basic components of an electric vehicle with an Android cell phone. The smartphone is connected to the vehicle through Bluetooth, so that an app on the smartphone can turn the vehicle on and off, control the vehicle forward and backwards, and turn the lights on and off. I developed an object detection system using LiDAR for the blind spot area on the passenger’s side per the request of our industry advisor. If an object is detected, it will alert the driver with lights, so that he/she can have enough time to avoid the detected object.
